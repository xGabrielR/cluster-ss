## `cluster-ss`: Cluster Silhouette Support

Clustering Problems is hard and much more hard in Python, do not exists some packages to faster implementation of metrics and others helpful supports like cluster analysis, visualization, estimators training and dimensionality reduction.
Note, This package was heavily influenced by the lazypredict package, I loved the ideia of one comand line for fit multiple estimators.

Based on this problems `cluster-ss` is a simple package to facilite implementation of this steps for clustering analysis, adding some simple ways to fit estimators and visualize one of my favorite metric, the *silhouette score*.

The package offers:

* Simple ways to visualize silhouette score and analysis.
* Fit functions from all sklearn cluster estimators.
* Setup multiple parameters to fit these estimators.

This is a simple study proposed package by Me, however I invite the community to contribute. Please help by trying it out, reporting bugs, making improvments and other cool thigs. :)
